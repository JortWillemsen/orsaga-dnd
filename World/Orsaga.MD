# Orsaga

A country hidden between a harsh mountain range. It lies in a deep valley that scales from north to south with only two entryways at each end of the valley. The country is the only passage trough the [Jégheyd mountain range](Jégheyd.MD).

With the upper part of the country covered in snow the route to the northern lands of [Isvind](Isvind.MD) is almost impossible and only attempted between june and august.
