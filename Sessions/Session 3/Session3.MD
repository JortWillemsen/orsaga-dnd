After meeting the wise oak tree and been told a future, you found a path to the village. After waking for aroud 4 hours you are back in the village where Bob is returned to his son (bobby) at the Călător Inn. Rud, the bartender thanks you and offers you a meal for free.

The party is drinking in the tavern (you can be more original, but it works for me!). They are approached by a small, nebbish-looking man who then asks for their help (feel free to play this guy up as being as nerdy and nervous as possible).

"Hi, my name is Radim Stiz. I'd like to hire you all. I'm a collector of rare artifacts and I have information about an old, lost library that contains a very rare historical artifact. I'd love to get my hands on it. Heading out on my own seems like a foolish idea, so I need a group of brave adventurers such as yourselves to accompany me." "The pay is 100 gold each. 10 gold now, and the rest once we are safely back to town with the artifact."

"What do you think?"

If players roll a high insight roll:

    He may not be telling you everything.

    He is very sure about there being a library, him being a collector, and he wants you to accompany him.

If asked about what the artifact is (or even work it into the conversation somehow, up to you): “Not sure exactly. My source only had a partial description, and the translation was likely not completely accurate. Evidently, it is a small statuette made either of garnet or maybe ruby? And it’s of some kind of marine animal. Probably a fish, but the translation was ambiguous.” *This is explained in the conclusion

Note: if at any point anyone is casting Detect Magic, keep Radim 30 feet away from them. He will get flagged as having illusory magic. If unavoidable - have them “turn off” the illusion and be some dis-liked race. Tell them it’s because of human prejudice.

The Dungeon

    The travel is uneventful (unless you have time for a random encounter).

    I use a simple fog of war, but feel free to set up dynamic lighting.

    The walls are made of stone that is cracked with age. The floor has some small debris and rodent droppings.

    The first room has a row of pillars and a simple wooden door to the north. There is nothing to find in this room. DC7 to unlock or smash the door.

    The dungeon further opens up into 3 connected rooms. The middle room, for now, appears empty, though describe it as having some large cracks in the walls.

Western room

The room is empty save for a single chest in the corner.

Trapped chest:

    DC 10 Investigation to detect a trap

    DC 12 Thieves tool to disarm

    Alternatively DC 10 Attack to smash/cut.

    The trap is a simple poison gas (1d6 poison damage), DC 15 Save to jump away.

    The chest contains an ornate red key.

Eastern room

    The room is empty save for an old skeleton in one corner, and a stone door to the north.

    The stone door has 3 keyholes color coded Red, Yellow and Blue.

Skeleton:

    DC 10 Investigation to find an ornate blue key.

    I usually have them see a glint of blue through an eye socket.

Middle room

    By this point, the party will know that they need to find the remaining yellow key. The key is in one of the cracks in the middle room on the north wall. Two options:

    Someone enterprising will be searching that wall. Give them a low DC challenge to notice something yellow in one of the larger cracks. Once they reach in they will be attacked by a grey ooze.

    Alternatively, and this is the more likely and fun scenario - have Radim search that wall. As the rest of the party is searching for the key, they will hear a scream and see Radim backing away from the crack and holding his arm which appears red and raw.

    Roll for initiative. This should be a super easy fight, though don't forget about Corrode Metal. It’s always fun to ask your players what their weapon is made of.

    Once the ooze is dispatched, you can easily get the yellow key.

    Once the 3 keys are inserted and turned the door opens.

The Library

    The party enters a large room with a number of pillars throughout. There is another stone door to the north.

    What they immediately notice is that the walls are lined with shelves, which are in turn lined with skulls. At this point, you can show them the Shelves of Skulls handout.

    DC12 Perception roll will notice that there are skulls of different colors, shapes, and sizes. There are lots of human skulls, but you also notice orc, minotaur, aarakocra, cyclops, dragon, etc. Note: here you mention exotic skulls but specifically exclude any skulls of the same races as the party member (e.g. if you have an aarakocra, skip that one)

    The party will start exploring the room. There is nothing to find besides skulls. They will most likely end up on the north side trying to open up the door. This is the perfect opportunity for:

The Twist

    The party hears the door they came through slam shut. As they turn around, Radim begins to laugh. He has a much deeper, more confident voice.

    "Ah, adventures… so easy to bait. Give them a quest and they'll come running. Show them a puzzle and they'll solve it. Easier than catching a trout with a nightcrawler."

    "Do you know the hardest and most exciting thing about being a collector? It’s finding rare and exotic specimens."

    Suddenly the illusion drops and the party sees a shadowy figure wrapped in a cloak with glowing purple eyes.

    "So when I saw the <number of party members> of you, I knew I had to have you for my collection!"

    Roll Initiative.

The fight

    So here is where things get a bit looser. Midar (Radim backwards, he's super original) has a range of spells that can help you balance the encounter. Group is struggling, use lower-level stuff, group kicking your ass, pull out the big guns.

    I usually start with him casting mage armor on himself (you see his body shimmer with more purple energy), and then he calls, “Rise, and get me those skulls!”, at which point he raises 2 skeletons.

    After one or 2 rounds of combat, based on how the group is doing, he raises 2 zombies “Protect your master!”

    Once the group gets him down to low HP, I usually have him misty step clear of melee and run into the double doors to the north. You describe seeing flashes of purple light through the cracks under the doors.

    1 to 2 rounds of combat to clear any/most of the remaining zombies/skeletons if they’re still up.

    At this point, the doors open up (unless like one of my groups, the players blow them open). Out steps the ghast (describing him as swole/jacked zombie always gets a chuckle). If anyone can see into the room, they see Midar huddled in the corner frantically muttering spells.

    Fight the ghast for 1 to 2 rounds. Don’t forget to have players roll CON saves for the Ghast’s Stench feature.

    If Midar goes down before the ghast/other undead, they crumble to the floor drained of the necromantic energy powering them.

Fun phrases for Midar to shout during the fight as retorts:

    “Specimens should be seen and not heard!”

    “You’re just a duplicate anyway!”

    Looking appraisingly at the head, and with disgust: “I guess I’ll have to take an irregular. I suppose it’s technically rarer this way.”

Conclusion

    The final room is full of treasure. Because it’s a one-shot feel free to hand them magic items and lots of gold since it doesn’t matter.

    There is a small ruby statuette of a fish on a pedestal (as mentioned in the intro). Have players roll a Nature check. Use a relatively low DC. If anyone passes, have them realize it’s literally a red herring (yay for dad jokes).
