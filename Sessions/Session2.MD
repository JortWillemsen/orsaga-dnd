Bob has been freed and you all stare at the scene that had just happened. A werewolf lies dead and turns back into its human shape.
As you rest for the day it becomes nightfall and you here a lot of strange noises around you. The thick woods are not easy to traverse. Especcialy not without a light source.


The goblins who's name is smitty, is sent by Cain Raducan to spy on the werewolf and see to the end of the job. If they do not return the village will be pillaged.

Its all a rouse created by the puppetmaster, a vampire maniac called Cain Rad√∫can. He payed the werewolf to steal the sheep so that the farmers got less money to farm for him since that's the whole market.
