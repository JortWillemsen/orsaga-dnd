It is a gloomy afternoon in july. The aspen trees are starting to turn yellow. The sun is setting in the east over the mountains as it gets cold and dark quick this high up in the hills. Wind and To find comfort in the warmth you book a room in the Călător Inn.

It is quite busy in the tavern. Some groups of halfling and human farmers are happy because the lambing season has just come to an end. 

Barxt the Red, taking a leave from your job as a sailer you heard from a friend there is big money to be made in the city just 50 kilometers north from here. Or as your friend phrased it: "rich douches doing rich douchy things, always money to be made there". You are sitting in the corner of the room. 3 tankards on the table of which two are already empty. You drink to fast for the bartender to attend to your full needs since he finds himself juggling almost ten plates of dirty dishes and some empty cups back to the bar. You are toying with a piece of paper you gathered from a community board. It reads: "REWARD": 50 gold pieces for the bounty hunter that can find the piece of shit that took 5 of my sheep. TIP: Find my neighbor. For more information find Bob Langley at the juhjuh farm.

Barxt - Perception check(8) - Something is stinking like mud

At the table next to you a man is sitting enjoying a some water. He is not just enjoying some water he is licking it out of a bowl.

Drakkis comes down the stairs. You are reluctant to do so because people don't really like you here. Wearing insignes of the sphinxes is frowned upon in these parts of Orsaga. Earlier when the you asked for a room the bartender advised you to take off your military clothing when walking around this town. **(Did you?)** .

The Bartender looks at you and signes you to come his way. 

Rúd: *I'm sorry, the tavern is very crowded. The only place for you to sit is at the same table as him. I will talk to him*.

## NEXT DAY

Its about 9 ish in the morning and the birds are chirping outside. It rained during the night so everything feels a bit moist. You all hear a lot of commotion outside.

Drakkis has a room with a window towards the street. A child is crying and you recognise the bartender trying to calm him down:

Rúd: *What happened bobby?*
Bobby: *Daddy hasn't come home tonight!*
Rúd: *What do you mean Bobby?*
Bobby: *He was guarding the sheep and I saw the gate open and now hes gone!*


Rúd knows someone strange has been coming here to eat but never to drink, he finds that strange. The stranger never gave his name and exclusively orders meat. He has rundown clothes and a big coat covering most of his body and gloves to cover his hands.

Neighbor = Somsed
Somsed saw Bob guarding the sheep and thought he was nuts doing this in the middle of the night when it was raining. Woke up and heard some growling, stood up and saw a light fleeing through the forest.
